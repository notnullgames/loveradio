# WIP

This is a collection of love2d blocks for [luaradio](https://github.com/vsergeev/luaradio).

Make sure [luaradio](https://github.com/vsergeev/luaradio) is installed, and you can use it in your love2d program to listen to audio.

See [main.lua](./main.lua) for example usage.

You can also use this to synthesize sounds, and do non-radio DSP stuff, if you like.
